In this project, I explored the rich functionalities of OpenCart(Frontend) application, an open-source e-commerce platform. From product management to checkout processes, I delved deep into understanding how each component interplayed to create a seamless shopping experience by manually.

Key Activities:

1. Test Scenario Creation: I meticulously crafted test scenarios as roadmaps to guide me through various user journeys and interactions within the platform. Each scenario was designed to cover critical aspects of the system.
2. Test Case Development: Transitioning from test scenarios, I developed detailed test cases by breaking down each scenario into step-by-step instructions. This ensured thorough coverage of functionalities, from user authentication to order processing.
3. Manual Testing: I conducted thorough manual testing to identify defects, inconsistencies, and usability issues. This involved navigating through the OpenCart platform and validating its functionalities.
4. Bug Documentation and Reporting: Throughout testing, I encountered deviations from expected behavior, commonly known as bugs. I meticulously documented these findings and provided clear and concise bug reports in Excel sheets. Additionally, I utilized bug tracking tools like JIRA to document and report identified defects, ensuring clear communication and tracking of issues throughout the testing process.

With this also created Test execution Reports and bug report in which how i executed and what bugs are there in opencart application is present it is done by manual testing methodology.

Through this project, I gained valuable experience in e-commerce testing methodologies and techniques. I developed a deep understanding of the OpenCart platform and its intricacies, honed my skills in test scenario creation, test case development,
and manual testing. Additionally, I improved my bug reporting capabilities and learned to utilize bug tracking tools for effective defect management.
